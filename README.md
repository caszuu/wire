This is a lil experiment with making a simple [Wren](https://wren.io/) VM and making it run a simple OS-like process scheduler. (`WiOS`)
Later will add networking capabilities to the VMs (nodes) making it a simple lan simulator great for toying around with hacking concepts.

This was originally planned as a full game but was downscaled to the core VMs as a proof of concept. Most of the heavy lifting is done the the [Wren language](https://wren.io/), go check them out!
